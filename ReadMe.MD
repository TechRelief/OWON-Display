**OWON XDM1041 Multimeter - PC Display**

This code was written to provide a PC display showing the current readings on the Multimeter for use when making videos for YouTube.

It uses OWONs version of the SCPI protocol and a test console is also provided to test SCPI commands.

This application does depend on the OWON provided USB serial driver to be installed and you will need to look using Windows Device manager to soo which COM port the driver was attached to.  You can then use the About box in the application menu to set the correct COM port number.
 
You can use OBS Studio to display the OWON Readings anywhere on the screen.

The code was written using Visual Studio 2022 with the latest .NET framework as of Mar 2023.
